  bird:{title:"Bird",author:"Noy Holland", body:[['The average writer, even a great writer, tends to lose focus of other elements when they turn to the sentence. Plot can go right out the window. Character and feeling tend to take a back seat. And for those of us that love this sentence-forward work this is all the better, it allows the reader too to luxuriate in the sounds and unfolding without having to keep track of the broader picture.'],['Here, in "Bird", Noy Holland has not only excelled on the sentence level, trotting out every trick in the book and inventing countless along the way, dancing across the page effortlessly so that the sounds and rhythm nearly fade into the background while being utterly upfront and dazzling, but also contracts a gut-wrenching portrait of a relationship at the edge of being and the life that is instilled with it, and torn apart by it.'],['"Mickey toppled his boots for Bird to stand on, on the clothes heaped at their feet. Now he was in her, disappearing, shade to shade, his cock like a bull`s in the shadow they cast. Bird slickened with blood she was losing still; on her breasts, hieroglyphs of his hands. Mineral seep. Her feet were pewter; a beetle wandered in the swales of her tendons, daubing methodically at the spatter of her blood. A speckled wind, iridescent. Nothing more moved buck Mickey, Bird-a shadow fused, a Gorgon`s head."'],['Much of the books rides this ledge between waking and dreaming, between the mundane and the mystical, these hints of memory and nostalgia and imagination seeping in, but the hard world always there, the hard pain and ecstasy of Bird`s being wrought like cold wood on the page.'],['"Her jaw was swelling; it was yellowing and blue.'],
['They made green together, yellow and blue. Blue and red made purple.'],
['And what did yellow and Bird make?'],
['And what did Mickey and Blue?'],
['`And Mickey and Bird?`` Mickey asked.'],
['And Bird said, `A bloody stew.``"'],["'Bird' has an unsentimental sentimentality, the love Bird feels for her son, for her baby, for Mickey so bone achingly deep, so strong it causes her to be drunk into sobriety, the clarity of the world turned up to the point of pain. Bird is neither victim nor perpetrator but raw vessel for the feeling of the world, a world so bright with pain and joy and love and loss that it warps the words within it, melts them together and causes them to kaleidoscope out, the only way it, and those within it, can be understood."]]},

    body:
      [["Utterly beautiful. Utterly brilliant. Utterly wracked with pain. First, the sentences. These are all turned inside out, as if the world they represent is itself turned from within. They slow your reading, cause you to lurch and jitter in your reading like the ones they represent bolt and halt through their own lives. This is not some hack or trick but a pure representation, the psychopomp's bare narration. Then the characters themselves: burnt into their pain, placed into a world turned utterly against them at every turn. We are no different but we can only appreciate their starkness."], ["Not only this, they are forced to live their pain through repeated emanations, cut into their various avatars by some cruel and distant god. Even through death their is no solution, even in mourning there is no relief. Identity, joy, pain, death are held up like lightless crystals, their facets shining points of blinding illumination on some awful chambers of the heart. These stories are not linked, they are interwoven, some ingrown labyrinth, some nested prison. These stories grow slowly, imperceptibly, one within another ultimately into something so much grater than their parts. Stunning contemporary fiction. Challenging, beautiful and terribly singular."]],

    body:
      ["Fantastic. Why are Moshfegh's short stories so incredible? Because she comes to points where other writers would languish or spin out or recoil in fear, where the story would get bogged down in over plotting or exposition and she (somehow) pushes through in majestic and unforseeable ways. Watching these moments is like seeing a rock climber come to an impassable flat spot on the rock face,and instead of shimmying aside or retracing their steps simply leaping over the spot. It's like seeing someone break the sound barrier for the first time."],
