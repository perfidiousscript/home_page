      [["Utterly beautiful. Utterly brilliant. Utterly wracked with pain. First, the sentences. These are all turned inside out, as if the world they represent is itself turned from within. They slow your reading, cause you to lurch and jitter in your reading like the ones they represent bolt and halt through their own lives. This is not some hack or trick but a pure representation, the psychopomp's bare narration. Then the characters themselves: burnt into their pain, placed into a world turned utterly against them at every turn. We are no different but we can only appreciate their starkness."], ["Not only this, they are forced to live their pain through repeated emanations, cut into their various avatars by some cruel and distant god. Even through death their is no solution, even in mourning there is no relief. Identity, joy, pain, death are held up like lightless crystals, their facets shining points of blinding illumination on some awful chambers of the heart. These stories are not linked, they are interwoven, some ingrown labyrinth, some nested prison. These stories grow slowly, imperceptibly, one within another ultimately into something so much grater than their parts. Stunning contemporary fiction. Challenging, beautiful and terribly singular."]],

      ["Fantastic. Why are Moshfegh's short stories so incredible? Because she comes to points where other writers would languish or spin out or recoil in fear, where the story would get bogged down in over plotting or exposition and she (somehow) pushes through in majestic and unforseeable ways. Watching these moments is like seeing a rock climber come to an impassable flat spot on the rock face,and instead of shimmying aside or retracing their steps simply leaping over the spot. It's like seeing someone break the sound barrier for the first time."],
